The XY Business Game

The XY Business Game is a fun simulation that models technology evolution.
It offers players (both individuals and teams) a chance to see how they tend
to respond to risk and reward.
In the simulation two companies, comprised of four squads each,
compete against each other in a series of rapid decision rounds,
with each squad's earnings based on their decisions.
During the game a company or squad may ask to purchase XY consulting
advice (using some of their earnings).
The session will consist of playing the game, followed by a retrospective.
It is based on a simulation originally devised by Jerry Weinberg.
The evening game will be run by Jon Jagger and Mike Long.
Needs a minimum of 8 participants, ideally 16 or more.
Laptops are not required.
